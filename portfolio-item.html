      <h2>Technical Overview</h2>
      <p>
        I worked on this app with 2 other software engineers. We created the app
        using React.js. The backend, which was built using Node.JS, Express, and
        MySQL, was what I worked on the most, but I also developed front-end
        routes.
      </p>

      <h2>Technical: Backend</h2>
      <p>
        I managed the backend by creating functions to give the pet a birth date
        and time, to retrieve the age, to decide if it was hungry, and to make
        it poop.
      </p>

      <p>
        I hate to ruin your childhood, but I made the pet hungry, made it poop,
        and made it grow using MySQL functions such as "SELECT TIMEDIFF()",
        putting those functions into backend routes using Express apps. It sucks
        to know that my virtual pet back in 1998 pooped because of math and
        algorithms, but figuring out these MySQL functions were among my
        proudest accomplishments during this project. (It's not surprising that
        I enjoyed this part since in my past life I was an Excel spreadsheet
        whiz).
      </p>
      <p>
        A very childhood memories neutral contribution of mine was creating
        database and helper model files to connect the application to a MySQL
        databases.
      </p>
      <h2>Technical: Frontend</h2>
      <p>
        I also worked on the frontend, developing frontend routes in React.js to
        show that the pet pooped and a route clean and feed the pet.
      </p>
      <p>
        To crush your childhood memories even further (I am so sorry), but I
        used conditional statments that retrieved an image of poop or the pet at
        certain life stages based on a number that was retrived from the
        backend-- for age, this was time since last eaten and for poop, this was
        time since pet was created respectively.
      </p>

      <h2>Agile methology</h2>
      <p>
        This project was done in collaboration with two other software
        developers. It involved 3 sprints, weekly retrospectives, and hourly
        standups.
      </p>
      <p>
        Accomodating everyone's work style was not easy--some of us liked to
        work in teams while other prefered to work alone--and the MERGE
        conflicts were pure hell, but I really enjoyed using the Agile methology
        to figure out the best methods to work with everyone was really
        rewarding.
      </p>

      <h2>Testing</h2>
      <p>
        I tested the backend routes using Postman!
      </p>
      <h2>Users</h2>
      <p>
        My niece, 8 years, and my nephew, 5 years, love using this app. Their
        favorite things are to check on pets, feed them, clean their poop, and
        create new pets with weird names like gk19.
