      <h2>Non technical overview</h2>
      <p>
        This was the first react app I created from scratch (other than your run
        of the mill to-do lists). It was the first app that I created because I
        wanted to, because I wanted a job at Co-Star Astrology or to make an
        comparable to what they had but better!!
      </p>
      <h2>Technical Overview</h2>
      <p>
        In a one-week Sprint, I developed an MVP (Minimum Viable Product) with 2
        features--sun sign and rising sign retrieval. I had so much fun creating
        this app.
      </p>

      <h2>Features</h2>
      <p>
        MVPs usually require adding one feature, but I added more than that.
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>Users could add their birthdate and birth times</li>
        <li>
          Users could retrieve their sun sign (the sign that most people already
          know)
        </li>
        <li>
          Users could retrive their rising sign (which requires knowing your
          birth time and is not something everyone knows)
        </li>
        <li>
          Upon pressing the submit button users received a description of their
          sun sign
        </li>
      </ol>
      <h2>Challenges</h2>
      <p>
        So creating this app helped me to develop a lot more respect for
        astrologers--even though astrology was already a hobby of mine. My goal
        was actually to be able to retrieve the full chart of each user, which
        includes the sun and the rising sign (which I was able to caculate on my
        own) the moon, along with all the planets including Pluto.
      </p>
      <p>This goal turned out to be challenging to achieve.</p>
      <p>
        In order to calculate this, I would have needed an API which costs a lot
        more money than I had access to or using an ephemeris which is available
        in Farmer's Almanacs. But entering the data for millions of birth times
        and places would have required more time than I have left on this
        earth--it already required about 400 lines of code to calculate the sun
        and rising signs. In future, I would love to have access to an ephemeris
        API or utilize an equation that could retrieve the placement of the
        users planets utilizing the longitude, latitute, and time and date of
        the user's birth. I would also love to figure out how to shorten the
        code to fewer lines of code.
      </p>
      <p>
        Another important issue to add is the way I calculated the rising sign
        was my using a chart that I could online. Rising signs ideally change
        every 2 hours. However, the further you were born from the equator, the
        less this becomes true. Certain parts of the world, signs do last in the
        rising sign for about two hours. Some stay for three. Some stary for 1.
        Therefore, the app was not 100% accurate when calculating the rising
        sign. In the future, access to an ephemeris API would mitigate these
        inaccuracies
