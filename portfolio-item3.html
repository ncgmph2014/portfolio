      <h2>Non technical overview</h2>
      <p>
        This was the first react app I created from scratch--other than your run
        of the mill to-do list. It was the first app that I created because I I
        wanted a job at Co-Star Astrology or to make an comparable app to what
        they had but better!! Or simply more stylish than Astrology Cafe (no
        shade).
      </p>
      <h2>Technical Overview</h2>
      <p>
        In a one-week Sprint, I developed an MVP (Minimum Viable Product) with 2
        main features--sun sign and rising sign retrieval. I had so much fun
        creating this app but creating astrology apps is way harder than I had
        imagined!
      </p>

      <h2>Features</h2>
      <p>
        MVPs usually require adding one feature, but I added more than one.
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>Users could add their birthdate and birth times.</li>
        <li>
          Users could retrieve their sun sign--the sign that most people already
          know and is determined just by your birthday.
        </li>
        <li>
          Users could retrieve their rising sign--which requires knowing your
          birth time and is not something everyone knows.
        </li>
        <li>
          Upon pressing the submit button users received a description of their
          sun sign.
        </li>
      </ol>
      <h2>Challenges</h2>
      <p>
        So creating this app helped me to develop a lot more respect for
        astrologers--even though astrology was already a hobby of mine. My goal
        was actually to be able to retrieve the full chart of each user, which
        includes the sun and the rising sign (which I was able to calculate on
        my own) the moon, along with astrological placements of all the planets
        including Pluto--for example my Mercury is in Aquarius, according to
        <a href="https://www.costarastrology.com/">Co-Star</a> and
        <a href="https://astro.cafeastrology.com/natal.php">Astrology Cafe</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        This goal turned out to be way more challenging to achieve than I had
        imagined.
      </p>
      <p>
        In order to calculate the placement of a user's planets and moon, I
        would have needed an
        <a href="https://www.astro.com/swisseph/swepha_e.htm">ephemeris</a> API
        which costs a lot more money than I had access to. I could have also
        entered in data manually using ephemeris from a Farmer's Almanacs. But
        entering the data for millions of birth times and places would have
        required more time than I have left on this earth--it already required
        about 400 lines of code to calculate the sun and rising signs. In
        future, I would love to have access to an ephemeris API or utilize an
        equation that could retrieve the placement of the users planets
        utilizing the longitude, latitude, and time and date of the user's
        birth. I would also love to figure out how to shorten the code to fewer
        lines of code.
      </p>
      <p>
        Another important issue to add is that the way I calculated the rising
        sign was my using a chart that I found online that said that rising
        signs change every two hours. While ising signs ideally change every 2
        hours, the further you are from the equator, the less this becomes true.
        In certain parts of the world, signs do stay in the astrological
        placements for about two hours. Some stay for about three hours. Some
        stay for about one hour. Because of this, the app was not 100% accurate
        when calculating the rising sign. In the future, access to an ephemeris
        API would mitigate these inaccuracies.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you are interested in seeing my atrology app improve and have the
        money to fund this project or would like to hire me to work on your
        already existing or future astrology app, feel free to email me using
